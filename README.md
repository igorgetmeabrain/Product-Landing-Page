# Product Landing Page (freeCodeCamp challenge)

This project was created to fulfil an element of the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp.  
The main aim of the project is to create a Landing Page for a prospective website, which features logos, a navigation bar and product information and videos.

## Project Criteria

The required user stories are:  
1. My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
2. I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
3. Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
4. I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
5. When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
6. I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
7. My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
8. Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
9. The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
10. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
11. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
12. When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page.
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
14. My product landing page should have at least one media query.
15. My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.

The project is submitted via Codepen, using a CDN link to run tests to verify completion of the user stories:

## Design

I used this opportunity to start development on an online gallery for an artist, showcasing different styles and mediums of their work.
I aimed for an understated, elegant style, which allows the artworks to speak for themselves.
Other than the required elements, I chose to experiment with the following additional techniques:  
1. I incorporated rudimentary JavaScript for the first time, to allow images to resize with onclick
2. A colour gradient background, which sits behind the main content of the page
3. With the fixed navbar at the top of the screen, I incorporated an HTML/CSS trick to prevent the navigation links from 'headbutting' the top of the screen and content thus being covered by the navbar
4. Using various hover techniques to make the page more user-responsive
5. Using CSS flexbox to adapt screen layout for different viewport sizes and orientations
6. Addition of footer to include social media icons and links to corresponding external accounts

## Conclusion

I learned several new techniques during this project, including incorporating JavaScript for the first time, using CSS flexbox, the 'anti-headbutt' method, and making all of these new techniques and elements responsive to differing screen sizes and orientations.
As with other FCC projects, the required user stories were a little restrictive, and I had to work around them to make the page work whilst complying with their requirements.
All content on the page is copyright of the artist and page designer. The videos are performed and created by me.
